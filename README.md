Lab 7: Analiza projektu Docker'owego (np. w≈Çasnego)	

A simple task manager web app. You can add, cross out/complete and delete tasks. They are saved in a postgresdb. Frontend is done with react, backend is done with node.

Everything is contenerized. God I hate devops and i hope that i won't need to ever do anything like this ever again.

When deployed, the site will be at localhost.

Peace!
